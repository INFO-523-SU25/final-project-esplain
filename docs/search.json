    "text": "Research Questions\nThe research questions guiding this project are designed to uncover latent patterns in officiating behavior within the WNBA using unsupervised data mining techniques. Rather than testing predefined hypotheses, the goal is to explore underlying structures and trends in referee decision-making that may indicate systemic tendencies or inconsistencies.\n\n1. Do home teams have significantly higher win rates under specific referee crews?\nThis question aims to identify clusters of referee crews associated with elevated home team win rates. The project will explore whether specific officiating crews are consistently linked to favorable home outcomes. Patterns that emerge may reflect officiating tendencies that unintentionally reinforce home-court advantage.\n\n\n2. When games are officiated by certain referee combinations, do they have higher or lower foul disparity?\nThis question focuses on foul differential as a key indicator of officiating style. The analysis seeks to reveal groups of crews with similar behavioral patterns. Identifying outliers or consistently imbalanced combinations may point to structural officiating trends.\n\n\n3. Do certain referees call more fouls on away teams?\nThis question narrows the scope to individual referees to examine whether certain officials consistently contribute to foul imbalances. The objective is to detect underlying officiating bias and identify individuals whose patterns deviate significantly from the normal."

    "text": "Analysis plan\n\nProblem Introduction\nThe Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA) has experienced significant growth in recent years, accompanied by an increasing emphasis on data analytics to enhance forecasting and anomaly detection capabilities. This project seeks to evaluate the fairness of officiating in the WNBA by applying machine learning techniques to referee assignment data, foul differentials, and game outcomes. The primary objective is to identify potential officiating bias and assess the extent to which individual referees may contribute to a home-court advantage.\n\n\nProblem Formulation\nThis study will examine potential officiating bias in WNBA games by analyzing referee assignment data, foul differentials, and game outcomes across multiple seasons. The analysis will proceed in the following stages:\n\n1. Data Collection and Preprocessing\n\nData Sources: Collecting data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brains14482/nba-playbyplay-and-shotdetails-data-19962021/data which is a play-by-play datasets with referee assignments.\nVariables of Interest:\n\nGame metadata: date, teams, location (home/away), final scores\nReferee assignments (names or IDs, crew combinations)\nTeam foul counts\nGame outcomes (win/loss, point differential)\n\nData Cleaning:\n\nNormalize referee names across games\nMerge datasets to associate referee crews with game-level statistics\nHandle missing or inconsistent values\n\n\n\n\n2. Exploratory Data Analysis\nTo validate that the data supports our research questions, key features were explored using distributions and summary statistics:\n\nSummarize foul counts by team and referee to understand Foul Differential Distribution.\nVisualize average foul differential by referee and referee crew to see if there is skewness which could suggest certain crews favor one side.\nCompute home vs. away win rates across different referee combinations Crews with consistently higher home win rates may indicate officiating bias regardless of foul disparities.\nGenerate pairwise correlations to identify potentially relevant feature groupings. Specific investigation will look at whether foul differential has a meaningful impact on scoring.\n\n\n\n3. Feature Engineering\nThe goal is to construct a comprehensive set of quantitative features that can characterize officiating tendencies and enable meaningful clustering. Below are several features that I plan to create:\n\nFoul Differential: The difference in total fouls called on the home team versus the away team. This feature serves as a proxy for imbalance in foul calls and is a central indicator of potential bias.\nTotal Fouls Per Game:\nThe sum of fouls called on both teams, capturing referees’ strictness or leniency in foul calling. Calculated as fouls called on the away team minus fouls called on the home team.\nAverage Fouls Per Team:\nComputed as total fouls divided by the number of games officiated by a referee or crew. This helps normalize foul volume across varying sample sizes.\nFree Throw Differential:\nThe difference in free throw attempts between the home and away teams, which may reflect the practical consequences of foul calls.\nHome Win Indicator:\nA binary variable denoting whether the home team won the game (1 = home team won, 0 = home team loss). Used to explore relationships between crew assignments and home-court advantage.\nReferee and Crew Identifiers:\nEncoded categorical identifiers for individual referees and three-person crew combinations to enable grouping and aggregation across games. Referee names will be normalized and mapped to a consistent ID to support aggregation. A composite key will be created for the three referees per game to analyze group effects.\nNormalization and Scaling:\nTo prepare for K-means clustering, all continuous features will be standardized (e.g., z-score normalization) to ensure that variables are on the same scale and contribute equally to distance calculations in the clustering algorithm\nAggregation Strategy:\nReferee-level features will be aggregated across games to create a per-referee profile. Similarly, crew-level statistics will be generated by grouping games officiated by the same three-referee combinations. This aggregation supports both individual and crew-based cluster analysis.\n\n\n\n4. Unsupervised Learning (Pattern Discovery)\n\nK-Means Clustering: Use K-means clustering to group:\n\nReferee crew based on game-level foul and outcome patterns\nIndividual referees based on their aggregated officiating behavior across multiple games\n\nDimensionality Reduction: Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify latent components in officiating behavior (such as home bias, foul volume, crew consistency)\n\n\n\n5. Cluster Interpretation\n\nAnalyze each cluster’s centroid to identify distinguishing features (such as high foul disparity, frequent home wins)\nLabel clusters based on behavioral tendencies (such as “neutral crews”, “home-favoring referees”, “high-caller crews”)\nIdentify any outlier referees or crews with extreme values\n\n\n\n6. Reporting and Visualization\n\nCreate visualizations including heatmaps, bar charts, and PCA plot to articulate findings\n\nPlot clustered referee data to visualize separation and cohesion\n\nDiscuss implications of findings in the context of WNBA officiating policy and fairness\nProvide future recommendations to improve the analysis"
