    "The research questions guiding this project are designed to uncover latent patterns in officiating behavior within the WNBA using unsupervised data mining techniques. Rather than testing predefined hypotheses, the goal is to explore underlying structures and trends in referee decision-making that may indicate systemic tendencies or inconsistencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Do home teams have significantly higher win rates under specific referee crews?\n",
    "\n",
    "This question aims to identify clusters of referee crews associated with elevated home team win rates. The project will explore whether specific officiating crews are consistently linked to favorable home outcomes. Patterns that emerge may reflect officiating tendencies that unintentionally reinforce home-court advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. When games are officiated by certain referee combinations, do they have higher or lower foul disparity?\n",
    "\n",
    "This question focuses on foul differential as a key indicator of officiating style. The analysis seeks to reveal groups of crews with similar behavioral patterns. Identifying outliers or consistently imbalanced combinations may point to structural officiating trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Do certain referees call more fouls on away teams?\n",
    "\n",
    "This question narrows the scope to individual referees to examine whether certain officials consistently contribute to foul imbalances. The objective is to detect underlying officiating bias and identify individuals whose patterns deviate significantly from the normal.\n",

    "The Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA) has experienced significant growth in recent years, accompanied by an increasing emphasis on data analytics to enhance forecasting and anomaly detection capabilities. This project seeks to evaluate the fairness of officiating in the WNBA by applying machine learning techniques to referee assignment data, foul differentials, and game outcomes. The primary objective is to identify potential officiating bias and assess the extent to which individual referees may contribute to a home-court advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "This study will examine potential officiating bias in WNBA games by analyzing referee assignment data, foul differentials, and game outcomes across multiple seasons. The analysis will proceed in the following stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Sources:**\n",
    "  Collecting data from <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brains14482/nba-playbyplay-and-shotdetails-data-19962021/data> which is a play-by-play datasets with referee assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variables of Interest:**  \n",
    "  - Game metadata: date, teams, location (home/away), final scores  \n",
    "  - Referee assignments (names or IDs, crew combinations)  \n",
    "  - Team foul counts\n",
    "  - Game outcomes (win/loss, point differential)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Cleaning:**  \n",
    "  - Normalize referee names across games  \n",
    "  - Merge datasets to associate referee crews with game-level statistics  \n",
    "  - Handle missing or inconsistent values  \n",
    "  - Feature engineering such as average fouls per team, foul differential, home team win indicator, and officiating crew identifiers  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "- Summarize foul counts by team and referee  \n",
    "- Visualize average foul differential by referee and referee crew  \n",
    "- Compute home vs. away win rates across different referee combinations \n",
    "- Generate pairwise correlations to identify potentially relevant feature groupings  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Unsupervised Learning (Pattern Discovery)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **K-Means Clustering:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "  Use K-means clustering to group:\n",
    "  - Referee crew based on game-level foul and outcome patterns\n",
    "  - Individual referees based on their aggregated officiating behavior across multiple games\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dimensionality Reduction:**  \n",
    "  Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify latent components in officiating behavior (such as home bias, foul volume, crew consistency)  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Cluster Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analyze each cluster’s centroid to identify distinguishing features (such as high foul disparity, frequent home wins)\n",
    "- Label clusters based on behavioral tendencies (such as \"neutral crews\", \"home-favoring referees\", \"high-caller crews\")\n",
    "- Identify any outlier referees or crews with extreme values\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Reporting and Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create visualizations including heatmaps, bar charts, and PCA plot to articulate findings  \n",
    "- Plot clustered referee data to visualize separation and cohesion  \n",
    "- Discuss implications of findings in the context of WNBA officiating policy and fairness\n",
    "- Provide future recommendations to improve the analysis  \n",
